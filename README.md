# Arduino-Boe-Bot-
# READ ME FILE 

This is an arduino project (used in conjuction with a BoeBot) that my partner and I worked on to commnicate and complete a set of tasks. We collaborated with 4 teams and their BoeBots. 

I was primarily responsible for Software Dev while my partner was responsible for hardware.

The final C++ arduino file is the file entitled Final_with_dance_party

I encourage you to look at the "Images:videos" folder to see an image and video of the bot performing the required tasks.
